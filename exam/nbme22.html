             <p>The concept is a convoluted way of asking if you knew how VDJ recombination works, which is that it is actually an example of <strong>altering the DNA</strong> of the B/T lymphocyte.</p>
<p>Southern blot technique: So when they use a probe against some region, and outputting a size of 1.5 kb or 6 kb, this is telling you the size of the DNA fragment in each cell (doesn’t matter if they say J probe or constant region probe, they’re just saying they’re targeting some nucleotide sequence found in the Ig locus/TCR beta chain locus respectively for B/T cells).</p>
<p>I think the confusing part could be wondering how you know whether you’re partly through rearrangement (answer choices B thru D) or if it hasn’t occurred at all yet (correct answer). Here, the concept is that B cells undergo V(D)J rearrangement in the bone marrow, while T cells do it in the thymus, and it all happens at once. So a plasma cell in the blood like in Multiple Myeloma would have fully undergone recombination, while a T cell in the blood could either be fully educated (and have finished VDJ recombination) or immature (hasn’t started VDJ).</p>
<p>Since the T cell gene was 6 kb and definitely bigger than the 1.5 kb gene, the T cell hasn’t undergone recombination yet.</p>

So is this because multiple myeloma produces excessive monoclonal light chain Ig? Is this the 1.5 kb gene? Whereas, T-cells that have not gone through differentiation yet and their J region includes everything (VDJ) vs. just VJ in the light chain? (FA 2020 pg 104)</span>

             <p>Which of the following reasons is why this question is bull? </p>
<p>1) Using the word "cyclic" instead of tricyclic for clarity</p>
<p>2) Knowing all of epidemiology of all drugs </p>
<p>3) having to reason out that anticholinergic effects are probably the worst over alpha1 or H1 effects to no certainty. </p>
<p>4) The crippling depression of studying for days-to-weeks on end to probably do average on the test.</p>

That someone went out and made a new TCA drug that would have less anticholinergic effects. </span>

             <p>Nitrogen balance is a measurement of <strong>protein metabolism</strong> in the body. A negative nitrogen balance indicates muscle loss, as increased amounts of amino acids are being metabolized to produce energy. This <strong>increases the amount of nitrogen secreted</strong> from the body.  Because the amount of nitrogen you are taking in is <em>less than the amount of nitrogen you are secreting</em>, you have a <strong>negative nitrogen balance</strong>.  </p>
<p>This man is malnourished, edematous, cachetic, and  has hypoalbuminemia. These clinical findings point to <strong>protein malnutrition (Kawashkior Disease)</strong>, which causes edema due to decreased serum oncotic pressure. Low oncotic pressure in this case is due to protein loss, and hence a negative nitrogen balance. </p>

             <p>This one was a little tricky. For this one the key is the low radioiodine uptake. This patient has high T4 and low TSH which makes sense in a hyperthyroid patient, perhaps your first thought is that this patient has Grave’s disease. However, in Grave’s your thyroid is being stimulated to make more thyroid hormone from scratch and as such would have an increased radioiodine uptake because the thyroid is bringing in the required (now radiolabeled) iodine. This is why it is not Graves (“release of thyroid hormone from a thyroid <em>stimulated</em> by antibodies”).</p>
<p>So if its not Grave’s what could it be? For this you’d have to know that Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis (also known as Chronic Lymphocytic Thyroiditis and is often referred to as such on board exams to throw you off) has three phases - first they are hyperthyroid, then euthyroid, then the classic hypothyroid that you would expect with low T4 and high TSH. This was the key to this question. The reason for this is that antithyroid peroxidase antibodies in Hashimoto’s cause the thyroid to release all of its stored thyroid hormone making the patient hyperthyroid for a short period of time. After this massive release of thyroid hormone, the antibodies make them unable to make new TH and therefore they become euthyroid for a short period and then hypothyroid which you would expect! Since they can’t make new TH, the thyroid will not take up the radioiodine and therefore there will be <strong>low</strong> radioiodine uptake. Hence, “release of stored thyroid hormone from a thyroid gland infiltrated by lymphocytes.” aka “Lymphocytic (hashimotos) thyroiditis”.</p>
<p>I think “release of thyroid hormone from a lymphomatous thyroid gland” is referring to some kind of thyroid cancer in which case you would expect them to be describing a nodule on radioiodine uptake.</p>

             <p>I think its the right MLF (area C), not the right abducens nucleus that is lesioned on the cross section. If the abducens nucleus were lesioned she wouldn't have abduction in her left eye. The MLF mediates cross talk between the abducens nucleus on both sides to the MLF on the opposite side (2 abducens nuclei, 2 MLF one on each side). In her case, her right MLF wasn't functioning hence why she was gazing left but her right middle rectus wasn't contacting to mediate leftward gaze. </p>

             <p><strong>Calculations for dad</strong>. The probability of the father being a carrier is 2/3 since it is <em>known</em> that he doesn’t have the disease. Then the probability of him passing it on to his kid is 1/2, thus:</p>
<ul>
<li>Probability of dad being carrier = 2/3</li>
<li>Probability of dad passing on disease allele = 1/2</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Calculations for mom</strong>. With the Hardy-Weinberg Principle, you can figure out the probability of the mother being a carrier:</p>
<p><code>q = sqrt(1/40,000) = 1/200</code> </p>
<p>So, <code>2pq = 2 * 1/200 * 199/200</code>, which is approx 1/100.</p>
<p>For the child to get the allele from mom, two things need to happen: (1) mom must be a carrier [“heterozygote”] and (2) mom must pass the allele to child:</p>
<ul>
<li>Probability of mom being carrier = 1/100</li>
<li>Probability of mom passing on disease allele = 1/2</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Puting it all together</strong>. Now, combine all together:</p>
<p>= (probability of dad being carrier) * (probability of dad passing on disease allele) * (probability of mom being carrier) * (probability of mom passing on disease allele)</p>
<p>= <code>2/3 * 1/2 * 1/100 * 1/2</code><br />
= <code>1 in 600</code></p>

             <p>Answer: Increased Central Blood Volume (CBV), Decreased ADH, Increased ANP.    </p>
<p>The physiological response to hypothermia is <strong>vasoconstriction of peripheral vessels</strong> (i.e. the ones in your extremities) in an effort to keep your core body temperature normal, and thus your organs functioning properly.  Peripheral Vasoconstriction will <strong>increase CBV</strong>. Increased CBV will cause an increase in preload, and thus cause an <strong>increase in ANP/BNP</strong>. ANP/BNP has inhibitory effects on the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System, resulting in <strong>decreased ADH</strong>. </p>

             <p>In biology, phase variation is a method for dealing with rapidly varying environments without requiring random mutation. It involves the variation of protein expression, frequently in an on-off fashion, within different parts of a bacterial population. As such the phenotype can switch at frequencies that are much higher (sometimes &gt;1%) than classical mutation rates. Phase variation contributes to virulence by generating heterogeneity. Although it has been most commonly studied in the context of immune evasion, it is observed in many other areas as well and is employed by various types of bacteria, including Salmonella species.</p>

    <span id="c2cbodylink">No, antigenic variation involves genomic rearrangement
Phase variation can be thought of as MORE or LESS of something. An on/off switch. No DNA is being rearranged, just under or overexpressed in response to the environment. </span>

             <p>"she feels happier and more relaxed" after starting kickboxing: this is a <em>MATURE defense mechanism</em> (classic textbook <em>sublimation</em>, as has been said). <strong>This question is just plain wrong.</strong> It's not displacement, because it's a healthy, socially acceptable outlet that improves her emotional state; punching bags are meant to be punched (thus it is actually NOT neutral). Displacement to an object would be punching a hole in her wall, or breaking her vase (I just like that imagery). Both of those would be better than punching her family, or breaking their car window, which is why it's displacement (unconscious redirection of an emotion to a safer object). However, kickboxing is LITERALLY an example in several psych textbooks for sublimation. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.</p>

    <span id="c2cbodylink">What if, just what if. Her taking time to do lessions was actually hurting her children by her having less time to spend with them and in turn not providing good care for them. (less of a mature defense mech now). 
Trust me I agree completely just not best answer, but given what we are given you could argue beyond that; amboss even says "a mom showing her feelings of anger towards the child instead of the actual problem, the husband". So in a way she is not addressing her actual problem (which she COULD address). </span>

             <p>The description of bilateral lower limb loss of vibration implies DCML damage, and the absent DTRs + Romberg seem to me to be implying that he possibly has tabes dorsalis from syphilis (or something very similar in presentation).</p>
<p>As for the other answers, A is wrong because his motor function is intact, B is wrong because pain and temperature deficits are not mentioned, C is wrong because it implies a specific nerve is entrapped, but he has lost bilateral sensation in his entire lower extremities</p>
<p>D is the trickiest, and I’m not 100% sure, but I would think radiculopathy of the anterior (ventral) roots would cause motor deficits since they carry motor efferents. You might also expect that motor dysfunction to be unilateral, since it would be unlikely to have a problem with the nerve roots on both sides. also the DCML is not located near the anterior roots of the spinal cord, so if the anterior roots were affected you really wouldn’t expect to see vibratory loss.</p>
<p>So basically process of elimination, I do feel like sensory neuropathy is an extremely vague answer though and I wasn’t a fan of the question.</p>

    <span id="c2cbodylink">This is a great rationale. I would like to add on that D is wrong because Radicular Neuropathy of the anterior lumbar roots would (1) be painful [radicular neuropathy is characterized by radiating pain (hence the word “Radicular”); this patient has numbness and tingling, not pain] and (2) because the anterior lumbar roots are the motor roots and do not carry sensory innervation. This patient is having a problem with his dorsal spinal cord (not anterior/ventral).</span>

    hello</a>&nbsp;
    <span id="c2cbodylink">Want to clarify that &#34;radiculopathy&#34; is not synonymous with pain. Radiculopathy can cause pain, weakness, or numbness.  

I think the only reason Choice D. was incorrect because it discussed the &#34;anterior lumbar roots&#34;, which would affect motor function. </span>
